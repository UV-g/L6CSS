    <h3>Football</h3>
    <p id="para">
        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the
        word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.</p>
        <p class="c1">Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the
        United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football
        (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league
        football; and rugby union football.</p>
        <p class="c2">These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes". There are a
        number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.</p>
